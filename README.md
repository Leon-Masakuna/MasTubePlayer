## Project description

Hello, I am LÃ©on Masakuna. Backend Developer and Database Designer. My app is named Personal Youtube Player

Personal Youtube Player is a web application that helps people who have google account to view and read videos of their subscribed channels.

I used React.Js, Vit and Youtube Data Api (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) to make this web app

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

-  To start this in local, you should write "npm run dev"

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template]

Then check my package.json file to see all the dependeces I installed to run my app

Such as :

    "axios" or "react-axios" : for fetching data
    "gapi-script" : for authentification
    "moment" or "react-moment": for converting time data from the api
    "react-google-login" : for google authentification
    "react-numeral" : for converting numeral data such as the number of like for a video
    "react-router-dom" : for pages routes
    "react-router-hash-link": for hash link
    "eslint" or "eslint-plugin-react": for static test
    "prettier": for code format
